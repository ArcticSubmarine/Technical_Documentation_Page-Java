# Technical_Documentation_Page-Java
A very minimalist responsive web design project I made to get familiar with this tech.

This project is a part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum focusing on responsive web design.

User story of the project here --> https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page
The text of my documentation comes from the exemple given in the user story.
